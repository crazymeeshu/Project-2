Our awesome game for Project-2

Anyway, is a good idea to keep in mind some guidelines...

# Project-2
Project 2 for CPSC-244 Level Design I

For this project, you will be creating a level as part of a production team! You will create all aspects of a level, from the paper concept and map layout, to the final playable product, then present the final project to the class. This project will count for the Elder God Assignment.


###Requirements
1.	Paper Concept and Map Layout
2.	Prototype (Gray box)
3.	Finished Playable Level
4.	Explanation of work breakdown between team members
5.	Present the playable level to the class

Your Finished Playable Level should incorporate many elements of level design, such as Meshes, Textures, Lighting. If you exclude one or more of these, there must be a *good reason* based on your design of aesthetic for the game.

###Important Stuff
1.	You can turn in all of these projects early (except the presentation).
2.	You can use this project to complete other assignments of level 2+. For example, if your project meets the assignment requirements of Turn Based (a level 2 Assignment), please inform me that you want it to count for that as well!

###Late Projects
For each piece of your product that is late, the project will be worth less XP. If the Paper Concept and Map Layout or the Prototype are late, the project is worth 500 XP less. If the Finished Playable Level is late, the project is worth 1000 XP less.
